            <p>Hi! I'm Amy. I'm an L3 Support Engineer living in Edinburgh - that means I fix old code and complain about the rain a lot!</p>
            <p>I started my first job in tech in September 2017 with very little prior coding experience - just some MATLAB from my time studying Maths at university. I'm now the Support Product Owner for a Java management application, and have so far successfully avoided working on anything MATLAB-related again!</p>
            <p>When I'm not writing code, I play Animal Crossing and drink a lot of peppermint tea.</p>
