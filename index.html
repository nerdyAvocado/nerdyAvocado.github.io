	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>Hi! I'm Amy - I'm an L3 Support Engineer living in Edinburgh - that means I fix old code and complain about the rain a lot!</p>
	<p>I started my first job in tech in September 2017 with no prior coding experience beyond some basic MATLAB at university. I work as a Software Engineer in an L3 Support team - I've since found out that's not a commonly used term! But basically my team are responsible for the maintenance of a product once it's been made handed over from the development team and is in use at customers.</p>
	<p>My main aim with this site is to pull together some resources that I've found useful over the last few years. Particularly for the learning I've had to once my initial ramp-up had finished, as that's when I found that I started to struggle to find exactly what I wanted to learn.</p>
