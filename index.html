        <p>Hi! I'm Amy. I'm an L3 Support Engineer living in Edinburgh - that means I fix old code and complain about the rain a lot!</p>
        <p>I started my first job in tech in September 2017 with no prior coding experience beyond some basic MATLAB at university. I work as a Software Engineer in an L3 Support team - I've since found out that's not a commonly used term! But basically my team are responsible for the maintenance of a product once it's been made handed over from the development team and is in use at customers.</p>
