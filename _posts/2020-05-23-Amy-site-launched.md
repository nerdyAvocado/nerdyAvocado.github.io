I've only ever really worked on backend code, so this site itself is the closest to web development that I've ever gotten! That means I only had a very rudimentary understanding of HTML when I started, and had never really looked at any CSS before. I'm using this post to keep a record of the useful, beginner-friendly resources I've come across when working on the site.

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). To get started, I followed Jonathan McGlone's tutorial [A Guide to Creating and Hosting a Personal Website on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

I picked the colours for my site using the colour palettes on [Coolors](https://coolors.co).

I used this tutorial to add a reading time to my blog posts, [Carlos Becker - Jekyll: Reading time without plugins](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/jekyll-reading-time-without-plugins).

The [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) game is a concise introduction to the flexbox syntax in CSS. I used Flexbox to make the css for my blog post index page easier to work with.

I implemented a tagging system for my posts, based on Long Qian's post on [Jekyll Tags on Github Pages](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).
