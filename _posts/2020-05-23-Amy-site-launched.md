I've only ever really worked on backend code, so this site itself is the closest to web development that I've ever gotten! It's built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), following Jonathan McGlone's tutorial [A Guide to Creating and Hosting a Personal Website on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

Hopefully it'll look a bit nicer once I've spent more than 15 minutes looking at CSS...
